# Polywrap Mini-Hacks 🌊

To incentivize all members of the ecosystem to experiment and create new ideas in a permisionless way, each trimester the Polywrap DAO will host a mini-hackathon where the best projects will be selected by other members of the Polywrap DAO, and a reward pool of 60 WRAP-IOU tokens will be shared pro-rata to all participants who received votes.

## How to participate 🔬

**Work on something you're interested in relating to Polywrap!** The domain for these projects include the following hack ideas: 

- New Polywrappers!
- Apps and Demos
- Product Designs
- Logo Designs
- Business Strategies
- Written Articles
- Memes
- Anything really

*We encourage you to share ideas and progress in the Polywrap Discord to get feedback from other team members and polish your concepts. 🌿*

## When? 📅

Mini-hacks will start the first day of each trimester.
All hack submissions should be submitted before the end of the trimester.

## How to submit a hack ⛵️
1. Before the trimester ends, [create an issue](https://github.com/polywrap/mini-hacks/issues/new?assignees=&labels=submission&template=mini-hack-submission.md&title=%5BMinihack+Title%5D+-+%5BYour+name%5D) in this repository describing your project in full.
2. That's it!

Judges will be voting based on your issue's contents. 

## Judges and voting 👍
By the end of each round, the WRAP-IOU token holders will be able to vote on the submissions they believe are the coolest. 

**How to vote**: If you hold WRAP-IOU tokens, you'll be able to vote on submission through [Tokenlog.xyz](http://tokenlog.xyz/polywrap/mini-hacks) 

The voting period will last 7 days after the end of each trimester, and the recorded score on that date will be used to distribute the rewards.

## Rewards and prizes 🏆

The reward pool will be shared pro-rata with all other submissions who received votes on that same round. (For example, if there are 1000 total votes in all of the submissions, and your hack received 100 votes, you'll get 10% of that rounds's reward pool)
