# Web3API Mini-Hacks 🌊 (Round I)

To incentivize all members of the ecosystem to experiment and create new ideas in a permisionless way, each month the Web3API DAO will host a mini-hackathon where the best projects will be selected by other members of the DAO, and a reward pool of (40? W3API tokens -> TODO: Create Spending Proposal) will be shared pro-rata to all participants who received votes.

## How to participate 🔬

**Work on something you're interested in relating to Web3API!** The domain for these projects include the following hack ideas: 

- New Web3APIs
- Apps and Demos
- Product Designs
- Logo Designs
- Business Strategies
- Written Articles
- Memes
- Anything really

*We encourage you to share ideas and progress in the Web3API Discord to get feedback from other team members and polish your concepts. 🌿*

## Wen? 📅

Mini-hacks will start the first day of every month.
All hack submissions should be submitted before the end of the month.

## How to submit a hack ⛵️
1. [Create an issue](https://github.com/Web3-API/mini-hacks/issues/new) in this repository, describing your project in full.
2. Mark the issue with the label "[submission]".
3. That's it!

Judges will be voting based on your issue's contents.

## Judges and voting 👍
By the end of each round, the W3API token holders will be able to vote on the submissions they believe are the coolest. 

**How to vote**: If you hold W3API tokens, you'll be able to vote on submission through [Tokenlog.xyz](http://tokenlog.xyz/web3-api/mini-hacks) (TODO: Make Repo Public) . (Please abstain from voting on your own hacks!)

Voting will end after the 7th day of each month, and the recorded score on that date will be used to distribute the rewards.

## Rewards and prizes 🏆

The reward pool will be shared pro-rata with all other submissions who received votes on that same round. (For example, if there are 1000 total votes in all of the submissions, and your hack received 100 votes, you'll get 10% of that month's reward pool)

 You can message Roberto, Steff, or Jordan if you need any help. Additionally, you can always send a message through the Web3API Discord.
